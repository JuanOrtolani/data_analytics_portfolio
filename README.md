## Project 1: Commercial Planning Insights

**Brief:** This dashboard was designed during my time at Coca-Cola to monitor the main business variables in the beverage industry (Volume, Price, Revenue, Discounts, and Market Share). For each of these, the dashboard shows monthly trends and comparisons versus Previous Years, Projections, and/or Competitors, as applicable.
For effective storytelling, an initial *"Resumen"* section was created to quickly provide a complete overview of the results. Each variable then has its own section for a deep dive to obtain specific details in each case.
In all cases, the results for the last month and Year-to-Date (YTD) can be observed.

**Technology:** Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Nielsen

The dashboard has the capability to dynamically recalculate results and allows for navigation through different levels of granularity. It provides insights both at the corporate level and down to the finest details, including customer-by-customer analysis to see which items have been purchased and which are still pending in order to meet the coverage target.

It provides detailed insights into sales and pricing with various breakdowns and levels of granularity, such as sales regions, sales management, brands, product types/groups, and sales channels.
Additionally, it calculates the remaining sales needed, considering the remaining sales days of the month, and compares the results against estimates, past performance, and recent sales.
